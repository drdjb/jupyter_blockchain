    "A blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called blocks, and these blocks can contain transactions, filees or any other data and something unique about them is that they are chained together using hashes, which are values created using a hash function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash function is simply a function that takes in an input value creates an output value based on that input value, which means that for any \"x\" input value, you will always receive the same \"y\" output value whenever the hash function is run so that every input has a determined output, usually the output is displayed as a hexadecimal number, and so think of this as \"encryption\" in a way.\n",

    "\n",
    "A hash function is simply a function that takes in an input value creates an output value based on that input value, which means that for any \"x\" input value, you will always receive the same \"y\" output value whenever the hash function is run so that every input has a determined output, usually the output is displayed as a hexadecimal number, and so think of this as \"encryption\" in a way.\n",
